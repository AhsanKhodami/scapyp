# About Me

**Mohammad Ahsan Khodami**  
Currently a **Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellow** at the [Department of General Psychology](https://dpg.unipd.it) at the [University of Padua](https://unipd.it).

My main research interests lie in the fields of **Attention**, **Visual Attention**, **Visual Cognition**, **Visual Processing Speed**, and **novel treatments for visual deficits and cortical blindness**. I am currently involved in a project focused on **improving visual processing speed** in patients with cortical blindness or other visual deficits. In addition, I am investigating the various roles of cognitive states in **visual search** and **visual cognition**.

My research utilizes a variety of methods, including **EEG**, **Eye Tracking**, and **Online Experiments**, to address questions in these areas. I am also passionate about **computational methods**, **statistical improvements**, and how these can enhance the quality of research in visual and cognitive sciences.

The current package I am working on is one of the latest efforts to assist scientists in **improving research quality** and utilizing **Python packages** for statistical analysis.
